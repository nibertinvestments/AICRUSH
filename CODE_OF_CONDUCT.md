# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community
* Supporting the mission of building practical, reliable AI coding tools

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Sharing proprietary code, credentials, or sensitive project information
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Project-Specific Standards

In addition to the general standards above, contributors to AICRUSH should:

### Technical Standards
* **Code Quality**: Submit well-tested, documented code that follows project standards
* **Security First**: Never compromise security for convenience or speed
* **Practical Focus**: Prioritize solutions that solve real coding problems
* **Incremental Progress**: Favor small, well-tested improvements over large changes

### Professional Conduct
* **Constructive Feedback**: Provide actionable, respectful code review comments
* **Knowledge Sharing**: Help other contributors learn and improve
* **Problem-Solving**: Focus discussions on technical solutions and project goals
* **Collaboration**: Work together to build the best possible AI coding assistant

### Communication Guidelines
* **Clear Communication**: Use precise, professional language in issues and PRs
* **Respectful Disagreement**: Discuss technical decisions respectfully and with data
* **Helpful Support**: Assist new contributors with patience and clear guidance
* **Privacy Respect**: Keep confidential project information secure

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct specifically applies to:
* All repository activities (issues, pull requests, discussions)
* Code reviews and technical discussions
* Community events and presentations
* Any communication using project channels

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[josh@nibertinvestments.com](mailto:josh@nibertinvestments.com).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

### Reporting Guidelines

When reporting incidents, please include:
* **Description**: What happened and when
* **Context**: Relevant background information
* **Evidence**: Screenshots, links, or other documentation
* **Impact**: How the behavior affected you or the community
* **Desired Outcome**: What resolution you're seeking

### Confidentiality

All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality. We will not
share reporter information without explicit consent, except as required by law.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.

## Project-Specific Enforcement

### Security Violations
Violations of security practices (such as committing credentials or sharing
sensitive information) will result in immediate temporary access suspension
while the incident is investigated and remediated.

### Code Quality Issues
Repeated submission of low-quality code or failure to follow project standards
may result in additional review requirements or contribution restrictions.

### Professional Conduct
Unprofessional behavior in code reviews, technical discussions, or project
communications will be addressed through progressive enforcement steps.

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been unfairly sanctioned, you may appeal by:
1. Sending a detailed explanation to [josh@nibertinvestments.com](mailto:josh@nibertinvestments.com)
2. Including relevant evidence or context
3. Requesting a review of the decision

Appeals will be reviewed by community leaders not involved in the original
enforcement decision when possible.

## Positive Recognition

We also want to recognize positive contributions to our community:

### Community Champions
Contributors who consistently demonstrate:
* Helpful support for new contributors
* High-quality technical contributions
* Positive community engagement
* Advancement of project goals

### Recognition Methods
* Attribution in release notes and documentation
* Special contributor status
* Invitation to project planning discussions
* Public acknowledgment of significant contributions

## Continuous Improvement

This Code of Conduct is a living document that will evolve with our community.
We welcome feedback and suggestions for improvement through:
* GitHub Discussions
